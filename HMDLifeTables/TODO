List of changes needed in this package

6/2/2017:   See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20596433/how-to-divide-each-row-of-a-matrix-by-elements-of-a-vector-in-r
            Of the equivalent ways to calculate a swept matrix:
                microbenchmark(times=100L,
			  "1" = t(t(mat) / dev),
			  "2" = mat %*% diag(1/dev),
			  "3" = sweep(mat, 2, dev, "/"),
  			  "5" = mat / rep(dev, each = nrow(mat)),
			  "6" = mat / t(replace(t(mat), TRUE, dev)),
			 "10" = mat/dev[col(mat)])
            the code uses #1 in a few places.  The only understandable code is #2 and #3 but
            #3 (my favorite) is 2x slower than #1 and almost 4x slower than #2, which is the
            fastest of all the methods.   Action: modify code to replace occurrances of #1 with #2.

6/2/2017:   correct Exposures, to align with Dima's spreadsheet example  DONE

5/30/2017:  smoothing using quadratic for pi.hat in ltperBoth_AxN needs replacing so that there is no downturn in percentage female
5/30/2017:  MPVERSION should be of the form N.MM  that is support minor revisions.  Yet code treats as integer. Systematically
            change throughout to allow for this, i.e. no MPVERSION == 5.  This could be floor(MPVERSION)==5
5/30/2017:  modify Exposures calcs and output to do triangles in addition to squares.
5/30/2017:  perform experiment to determine problems with V6 monthly birth estimations, under situation of range of neonatal/perinatal mortality
5/30/2017:  add friendly CSV output and/or sqlite or postgresql.  Refer users to HFD for monthly births

6/27/2016:  The Exposures* routines read monthly birth files with each pass.  There are probably several other
   cases like this where data files are read repeatedly.  Restructure so that InputDB files
   are read only a single time and saved in Rbin   

6/27/2016:  related to above, make sure that data input to a country run occurs a single step, with 
   needed checks.  --> add XYZmonthly.txt  to the read inputDB routine, including head check.
   An error encountered was 'LexisDB' instead of 'LDB' as the last column name in the csv file.

6/27/2016: Dima wishes a tightening of defaults, e.g. when v6 applies, the monthly.txt file is not optional
