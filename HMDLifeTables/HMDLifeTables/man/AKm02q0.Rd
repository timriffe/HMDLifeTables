\title{AKm02q0 derive m0 from q0}
\usage{
  AKm02q0(m0, constant, slope)
}
\arguments{
  \item{m0}{a value of m0, per the period lifetable
  derivation}

  \item{constant}{the intercept of the relevant
  Andreev-Kingkade segment}

  \item{slope}{the slope of the relevant Andreev-Kingkade
  segment}
}
\value{
  q0 the estimate of q0 according to the identity between
  a0, m0, q0
}
\description{
  Derive m0 from q0 according to the relevant segment of
  the Andreeve-Kingkade formula. This is elegant because
  it's an analytic solution, but ugly because, man, look at
  it. Carl Boe got this from Maple I think. This formula is
  only necessary because AK start with q0 whereas the HMD
  starts with m0, so we needed to adapt.
